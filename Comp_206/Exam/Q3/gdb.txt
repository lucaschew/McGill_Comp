1) 
You would do "gdb (executable name)" and then do "b (executable name)" and set a breakpoint where the program begins to fail. 
You can then do run in order to go the that line.

2) 
You can check whether func encode is being passed a NULL, by printing the variable in which is going into the function. 
You can get to that line by type "n" to move into the next line. 
You could check that encode is working properly but running encode by itself with a custom parameter.

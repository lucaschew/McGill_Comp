# Conceptual Questions

1. Give four reasons why a cloud machine is better than a laptop for data science work at scale.

   - More storage
   - More computing power
   - Its more secure
   - Has more uptime than a laptop or desktop

2. List out the stages in the data science process and define each (in 1 sentence)

   - Question Definition
     - When a question is a specific inquiry where you define the problem, declare objectives, and find a way to measure the outcome.
   - Data Collection
     - Obtaining and arranging data so that it can be used further in the stages.
   - Data Annotation
     - Applying or inferring features that will be used in analysis later on.
   - Data Analysis
     - Creating graphs or visualizations using the the quantitative data gathered.
   - Interpretation
     - How you view the results and how you come to a conclusion using those results.
   - Communication
     - Finding the best way to show the results to others so that it can be impactful.

3. What is the difference between data analytics and data science?

   - Data analytics is the ideal of looking at existing data and tools to try and draw a conclusion or use them to predict something in the future. In contrast, data science is focused on innovation, which can include new questions or tools.

4. Give an example of how a loop can occur in the data science process.

   - I want to track how many times a player has used a specific character in a team-based video game. When I am gathering data, I realized that sometimes that a different player on the same team picked the specified character, which results in the player being unable to pick it, so I have to redefine the question to count only when no one on the team has picked the character.

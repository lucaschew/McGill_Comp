# HW5 Conceptual Answers

## Question 1

A hospital wants to know how its medication stocks line up with patient demand in the hospital. Develop a use case that motivates this question by identifying a persona (presumably someone who works at the hospital) and a concrete activity that will make use of this information. Of course, we don’t have access to the hospital in question – so you’ll be developing your own use case. So there are many credible answers.

### Answer

A use case would be that the hospital wants to create a stockpile of medicine to improve patient care and quality during the hospital stay. Recently, they have been low on a certain medicine and they want to figure out which medicines they should order more often to always have a good buffer in case demand increases.

## Question 2

Why does the real world impact the complexity of code we write in a data science project?

### Answer

It impacts the complexity of the code that we write as we have to add different variables and factors that have real-world implementations into the code. It also has to do with the business and customer needs and how they are always increasing and changing.

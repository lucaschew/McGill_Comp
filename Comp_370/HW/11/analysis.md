## Task 5 Questions

1. What is the impact of including a stop word list?

It helps clear out some of the filler words that are used in the titles. For example in the naive word list, in the version without stops, there is a bunch of filler words such as "a" or "the". Compared to the version with stops, it filters out these words and give you the words that matter more.

2. What differences do you observe with TF-IDF?

In the TF-IDF documents, the words that are picked out are slightly more specific and meaningful compared to the naive ones. In some of the subreddits, TF-IDF score is about the same as the # of appearances though, but there is a slight difference.

3. Which method produces the best list?

I think TF-IDF produces the better list since it picks words that are important and show up fewer amount of times. This is better as it allows you to know which are the main subjects of each post.

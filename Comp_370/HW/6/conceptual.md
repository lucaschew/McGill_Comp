### Comp 307 - Homework 6 Conceptual Questions

##### 1. What is refactoring? Give three examples of refactoring techniques.

Refactoring is the idea of reorganizing the code to have the same functionality but written or organized better.

Techniques can be:

- Renaming
- Putting code into functions
- Replacing constants with variables

##### 2. In a data science project, why does code naturally go through “phases” of messiness?

Code can through phases of messiness because you could be dabbling and trying to find a solution, so you don't try to write clean code, and instead work on functionality and correctness first. After it works, you can go back and "tidy" back up the code.

##### 3. What are three techniques for creating more modular code?

- You can break code into functions, so that each function does 1 thing
- You can organize code into classes (like OOP)
- You can create packages to store and seperate code

# Taxonomy (Coding) Guide

## Motivation

The taxonomy for this Reddit page was created to organize and categorize various types of posts, making it easier for users and moderators to locate specific topics. The categories address common themes such as inquiries about class logistics, administrative concerns, and lost and found items, as well as broader topics like general questions and news. This structure helps streamline content, ensuring effective moderation and an optimized user experience. By classifying posts accurately, we foster community engagement, reduce redundancy, and provide clear avenues for resolving specific issues or inquiries.

# Error Assessment

## McGill Subreddit Posts

There were 9 disagreements in total, with 1 having no majority

For the majority disagreements, it was mostly because the edge cases for two categories were hard to discern. An example of this would be Complaint vs News, since some of the posts had misleading or sarcastic titles, making it hard to figure out whether they were stating or making an insult of something. Another point in which there were issues was between Class or Exam, since some of the titles were vague, such as "Comp \_\_ Grade" which could be referring to either the midterm or an assignment. If maybe I combined categories and then had stronger edges, this could be fixed.

## Concordia Subreddit Posts

For Concordia, there were only 5 disagreements, with all of them being majority.

I think for this one, the titles were a bit ambigious, since some mentioned class, but could also be a question in general. Another post was just titled "paper shredder" which could be a question or misc. Overall, I think this sample performed a lot better than McGill's.

led.circ:

- I don't know how to stop the clock after all the id numbers have gone through
- After the id, random numbers are shown

SequentialDivider.circ:

- I don't know how to stop the clock after the result is done. I just have a counter that tells when the result is produced. 
- Would prefer if you could manually click the clock until the led is shown.

Thanks!
